description: >
  Enable support for unescaped '{' and '}' literals in regular expressions,
  which is an ES6 Appendix feature (and non-standard before ES6).  Ecmascript
  E5 requires literal curly braces to be escaped, but most Ecmascript engines
  support them when they are not used in valid quantifier, and this behavior
  has been added to ES6 Appendix.

  This option is recommended because a lot of existing code depends on literal
  regexp braces.
